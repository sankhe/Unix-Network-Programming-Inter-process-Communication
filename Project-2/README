Files Submitted :

1. client.c
This is the client agent program, it takes the inputs fron user i.e. commands, according to command, selects the desired IPC mechanism.
If command is non-exit i.e. READ or DELETE, it transmits the message to server via selected IPC and wait for server to send the result.
Reads the server results via IPC and displays the results to stdout.
If command is EXIT, client first cleanup the server ( i.e terminate the server process) and terminates.

2. server.c
This is the server program, it reads the client requests (i.e. non-exit user commands) from the IPC.
Processes the commands and write the result back to the ipc for the client.

3. header.h
This file consists of comman header file and the message structure. 
Message Sructure is passed through IPC.

4. abc.txt, file1, file2, file3, file4
These are sample files perform non-exit command opertations i.e READ and DELETE file.

5. xyz.txt
This file has permission set to :  chmod 100 xyz.txt
The file With this permission, helps to test the testcase : "Enter READ command with file name which not having read access."

5. makefile
Makefile builds executable files from the source code.

6. README
This README file tells how to run the P2 and related information.

********************************************************************************************************************************************

Commands Used in P2:

1. SWITCH <ipc_mechanism> 
This allows  to select an IPC mechanism <PIPE|FIFO|SYSMQ|POMQ>.
The SWITCH <IPC> command should be the first command.
because IPC mechanism should be selected first, before any non-exit i.e READ and DELETE commands.

2. READ <file_name> 
This command reads a file with the specified filename.

3. DELETE <file_name>
This command deletes a file with the specfied filename.

4. EXIT 
This command, makes client first cleanup the server process (i.e. terminate the server process) and terminates.
