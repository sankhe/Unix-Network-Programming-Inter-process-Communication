COEN236 : UNIX NETWORK PROGRAMMING
PROJECT 4
Name: Najuka Sankhe
********************************************************************************

To run and execute Project4:

1) Please make sure that the server folder is present on the server’s machine and the client folder is present on the client machine.

2) Make clean and make client and server program respectively.

3) To find hostname :
	a.	Enter “hostname” on the server terminal.
	b.	This hostname must be provided as command line argument to client.

4) On server terminal please enter :      		./server [tcp/udp]
 
	If you want to run tcp enter tcp 	: 	./server tcp
	or if you want to run udp enter udp	: 	./server udp

5)	
	(a)	If you choose to run tcp server, then please run tcp client as follow:		./client tcp <hostname>
		Eg.    	./client tcp linux60802
	
	(b)	If you choose to run udp server, then please run udp client :
		./client udp <hostname>
		Eg. 	./client udp linux60802


6)	After client program is started, you can use following commands:
	(a) READ <file_name>
		To read the contents of the specified file name.

	(b) DELETE <file_name>
		To delete the specified file name.
	
	(c) EXIT
		This command will send “exit” message to server, so that server can terminated and client process exits.

File’s Submitted :
1. client folder : client.c and Makefile
This is the client agent program, it takes the inputs fron user i.e. commands, according to command, selects the desired IPC mechanism.
If command is non-exit i.e. READ or DELETE, it transmits the message to server via selected IPC and wait for server to send the result.
Reads the server results via IPC and displays the results to stdout.
If command is EXIT, client first cleanup the server ( i.e terminate the server process) and terminates.

2. server folder : server.c and Makefile
This is the server program, it reads the client requests (i.e. non-exit user commands) from the IPC.
Processes the commands and write the result back to the ipc for the client.

3. xyz.txt abc.txt, file1, file2, protect.txt
These are sample files perform non-exit command opertations i.e READ and DELETE file.
Protect.txt is for “permission denied” testcase.

4. Makefile
Makefile builds executable files from the source code. Makefile is submitted in client as well as in server's folder to build respective executables.

5. README 
This README file tells how to run the P4 and related information.
